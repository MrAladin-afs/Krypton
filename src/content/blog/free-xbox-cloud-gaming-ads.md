# Free Xbox Cloud Gaming Tier with Ads Confirmed

Microsoft plans to introduce an ad-supported, free option for Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud). This tier will make game streaming more accessible to users globally.

## The Free Tier Announcement

Microsoft has confirmed plans to launch a free tier for Xbox Cloud Gaming, supported by advertisements. This represents a significant shift in the cloud gaming landscape, making high-quality game streaming accessible without a subscription.

### Game Access
- Limited game library (compared to Game Pass)
- Rotating selection of games
- Access to popular titles
