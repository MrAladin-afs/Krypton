### 🇧🇩 What is Zero Hour? A Unique Bangladeshi Experience

Developed by the talented Bangladeshi studios **M7 Productions and Attrito**, *Zero Hour* delivers a serious, slow-paced, and highly methodical tactical shooter experience.

What truly sets *Zero Hour* apart is its deep connection to its country of origin:

* **Bangladeshi Setting:** The game is set in a variety of fictional locations **interpreted from real-life settings in Bangladesh**. The maps feature authentic, real-life scale environments that give the game a distinct and immersive atmosphere rarely seen in global gaming. You’ll be fighting in detailed spaces that include architectural elements and details found in the country.
* **Cultural Immersion:** The game features high-stakes missions, like hostage rescue and bomb defusal, where attackers are modeled after a typical Bangladeshi SWAT task force known as **MS-Unit 9**.
* **Tactical Focus:** Like titles such as *Rainbow Six Siege* and *SWAT 4*, the emphasis is on planning, teamwork, and resource management over run-and-gun action. Success hinges on using the **pre-round planning table** to formulate your precise approach.

#### **Key Features to Expect:**

* **Intense PvP Action:** Engage in dynamic **5v5 battles** in modes like Hostage Rescue and Bomb Defusal. Limited guns and gadgets are lost upon dying, making every decision critical.
* **Dynamic Environments:** Utilize elements like functional elevators, bulletproof glass, and a **breaker switch** to control building lights and add strategic depth to your missions.
* **Co-op & Solo Missions:** Team up for intense cooperative missions or go solo with up to 9 AI squad mates to practice your tactics.

*Zero Hour* brings a refreshing and culturally unique perspective to the tactical FPS genre, focusing on high-stakes, realistic close-quarter combat.
